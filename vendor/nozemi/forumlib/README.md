# Nozemi's ForumLib
Nozemi's forum library, as seen in Nozum - my forum software.
You can either build on this library yourself,
or choose to continue building on the whole forum software I'm developing.

Currently this library is under heavily development, and it's not recommended
to relay on it, as lots of stuff is going to change. This is also a way for me
to expand on my programming knowledge/skills, and knowledge/efficiency with
tools to assist me in the job.

The goal for this project is to create a simplistic, but functional and stable
forum software that people can use if they want to.
